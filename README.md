# From Diplomacy Discourse to On the Ground Events
1) Project Proposal:
   
I ask this question: Do weekly changes in diplomatic discourse from country i toward country j help anticipate protest/tension events in j over the next 1–4 weeks? 
I will create simple weekly signals from diplomatic texts (tone/stance/frames at the dyad level), match them with GDELT protest/tension indicators, and evaluate basic early-warning value.

2) Data To Be Used:

•	GlobalDiplomacyNet (GDN): Public diplomatic texts/relations across countries and years.

•	GDELT Events (v2): Global event records; we will use protest (root 14) and related tension/violence families (13, 15–20).

•	Lowy Global Diplomacy Index: Yearly diplomatic network/context measures.

All sources are public and will be credited and their licenses will be respected.

3) Plan to Collect The Data:

•	Gathering GDELT events for the study period and prepare weekly country outcomes.

•	Gathering GDN texts and prepare weekly dyad summaries (i→j).

•	Optionally adding Lowy context at the country-year level.

•	Combining everything into a single weekly dyad dataset for analysis.
